in IROS 2018 (oral)


## Prerequisites
This codebase was developed and tested with Tensorflow 1.0, CUDA 8.0 and Ubuntu 16.04.

## Preparing training data

We have defined an order that the data has to be preprocessed before training. 

For [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php), first download the dataset using this [script](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=raw_data_downloader.zip) provided on the official website, and then run the `prepare_train_data_stereo.py` with the necessary arguments.


## Training
Once the data are formatted following the above instructions, you should be able to train the model by running the `train.py`.

You can then start a `tensorboard` session by

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=/path/to/tensorflow/log/files --port=8888
```
and visualize the training progress by opening [https://localhost:8888](https://localhost:8888) on your browser. If everything is set up properly, you should start seeing reasonable depth prediction. 

## Testing

Download the checkpoints from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bg55pMxO7fgLoyB-yb6pjtUNc6zD4pqT?usp=sharing) and use the `test_kitti_depth.py` and `test_kitt_pose.py` with necessary arguments. 

## Evaluation

We have used the depth evaluation scripts from [monodepth](https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth) and the pose evalution scripts from the [SfMLearner](https://github.com/tinghuiz/SfMLearner/). 
We are very thankful the Monodepth and SfMLearner authors for their code bases.
